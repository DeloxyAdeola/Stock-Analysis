# Stock-Analysis
Stock Analysis for module 2
##The overview of this project is to give a clear analysis to steve and His parents, if their assumption based on a particular trade of stock will mull over the value of the stock of which he actually emphaized on DOAQ tickers. However, analysis was carried out on different tickers yealrly and our findings will be seen in this report.

### The Purpose. The main purpose is too peruse on the Stock Data for 2017 and 2018.Make findings on the specicific Data Steve's Parents emphasized on and also analysed other Tickers for a proper feedback.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis based on the DAQO stocks, in 2018, The total volume was higher and still had a negative returns whcich we can conter the believe of Steve"s parents that the price of stock will accurately relect the price. In the Year 2018.
Outcomes Based on Launch Date in the parent category (theatre) We can see that in the month of May, the sucessful outcome is higher compare to the other months and there are only 3 cancellations.which implies that, the month of May is a good month to carry out the fund raising.The total turnout in the month December is poor with a success rate for 37 and a failed rate of 35, which i can conclude that some natural factors could or will affect the out come of her theatre fund raising in the month of December. The best month/Date for louise to achieve sucess in her fundrasing campagin will be the month of May, June, July. even if the sucessful out come for july was 10% of decrease in a total of 100 for an example. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals Based of the goals.Outcome based on goal had a higher sucessful rate in a range of 1000 -4999, with this we can analyse that it got this successful due to the lesser amount and more people will be able to make donations without being stretched  and the toal project accomplished is higher same as column "Less than 1000". In all ranges, no projects were canceled. The analysis shows that the higher the goal the lesser the success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered The challenge is that Louise will not be able to meet her target based on higher goals margine.


## Results 1.Less Cancellation on the different outcome base on percentage 2. sucessful outcome is high in all launch date. 3. The failed outcome based on launch date flows between 39% - 55%.No cancellation on the outcome based on goal.
The failed percentage is higher the sucessful percentage in all ranges 

-# What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The launch date has a great effect on the outcomes because much consideration should a lot to consider with regards to the month or day of the launch, as you can see in our visualization. it could be that weather had effect on the months that were not sucessful thereby having a higher cancellation rate and failed outcome.


## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Based on goals, Louise should focus more on a range that all classes of people can be able to donate which is between 1000-4999 and do more campaigns on that particular target.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Questionaires were not carried out. 
The data is based on assumption.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Stacked bar, clustered bar, Pareto,clustered column
