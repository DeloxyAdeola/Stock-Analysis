# Stock-Analysis

Stock Analysis for module 2

##The overview of this project

The overview of this project is to give a clear analysis to Steve and his parents regarding how to diversify than investing all their money rather than on a particular trade of stock. I  mulled over the Daily Volume and returns of the stocks and analysis were carried out on differents tickers yealrly and our findings will be seen in this report.

### The Purpose. The main purpose is too peruse on the Stock Data for 2017 and 2018. Make findings on the specicific Data Steve's Parents emphasized on and also analysed other Tickers for a proper feedback. I looked into difference stocks  using VBA. I also ran analysis of the 12 diferents stocks and to know how they performed based on the total daily Volume and the returns and give analysis based on performance. For me to give an effiecnt and clearer analysis to Steve and other end users for easy understanding, i refactored the code and i noticed  that refactoring made the code more clearer. 

Analysis.
In the year 2017 , DQ had the lowest total volume and had the higest return as compared to 2018 where the total daily volume is higher than of 2017 but still have a negative (-) returns.As requested by Steve's parents' to know how actively DQ performed. DQ was on negative in 2018. RUN in 2018 had the higest return rate but do not have the highest Total daily Volume. TERP had a negative return in 2017 and 2018 meaning it will not be a good investment for Steve's parents.

The stocks with the best returns for 2017 and 2018 are; ENPH and RUN.
For 2017, the tickers that did well are; AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SEDG, SPWR, VSLR.
In 2018, majority of the stocks crashed and had a negative returns, However, ENPH and RUN stood out in return despite the overall negative outcome for the year 2018.
SPWR had the second highest Daily Volume and a had a higher negative -44.6% but has a high return value in 2017.

As Analyze here, trading a stock oftenly does not accurately reflect the value of the stock.

I refactored my code and it ran much faster.

Benefit of Refactoring are It helps to finding bugs. Makes the software esasy to understand. refactoring clears duplicate and improves the code effectiveness.its design also does not putrefy. 

It does not state a clear definition of a neat code. Refactoring could introduce new bugs and can also create errors into the code 
The Pros and Cons of refactoring a VBA Script
Refactoring a VBA Script usually helps to lower organization cost technically and it helps to increase performance.Howevers, the negative aspect of refactoring VBA script is that, if not properly done, it messes up some SCM and also creates Casade update.
