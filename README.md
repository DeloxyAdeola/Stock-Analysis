# Stock-Analysis

Stock Analysis for module 2

##The overview of this project

The overview of this project is to give a clear analysis to steve and his parents regarding their assumption based on a particular trade of stock. I  mulled over the value of the stock of which he actually emphaized on DOAQ tickers. However, analysis were carried out on differents tickers yealrly and our findings will be seen in this report.

### The Purpose. The main purpose is too peruse on the Stock Data for 2017 and 2018.Make findings on the specicific Data Steve's Parents emphasized on and also analysed other Tickers for a proper feedback. I looked into difference stocks  using VBA. I also ran analysis of the 12 diferent stocks and to know how they performed based on the total daily Volume and the returns the output was displayed with some  stocks that compare to the ones that didnt perform well. For me to give an effiecnt and clearer analyis to Steve and other end users for easy understanding, i refactored the code and i noticed  that refactoring made the code more clearer. 

Analysis.
In the year 2018, we can see that VSLR was the had the highest total daily volume of stocks but does not have the higghest return and a higher return compare to ENPH with total daily volume of 704,232,000.it is also suprising that TERP is on negative(-) return inspite of the total volume. The stock with the highest return is ENPH with a daily total Volume of 704,232,000

Benefit of Refactoring are It helps to finding bugs. Makes the software esasy to understand. refactoring clears duplicate and improves the code effectiveness.its design also does not putrefy. 

Disadvantages of refactoring.
It does not state a clear definition of a neat code. Refactoring could introduce new bugs and can also create errors into the code 
The Pros and Cons of refactoring a VBA Script
Refactoring a VBA Script usually helps to lower organization cost technically and it helps to increase performance.Howevers, the negative aspect of refactoring VBA script is that, if not properly done, it messes up some SCM and also creates Casade update.
